# Landing Page Project

Welcome to the Landing Page Project! This is a simple web project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that features a multi-section landing page with a dynamically updating navigation menu. The navigation menu contains buttons that allow users to navigate to specific sections of the page, and both the navigation buttons and the sections are highlighted as the user scrolls through the content.

## Project Description

This project is designed to showcase a responsive and interactive landing page with the following features:

- **Dynamic Navigation Menu:** The navigation menu is dynamically generated based on the sections in the HTML. It automatically updates to include buttons for each section, making it easy for users to jump to their desired content.

- **Section Highlighting:** As the user scrolls down the page, the current section being viewed is highlighted in both the navigation menu and the page content. This provides a visual indicator of the user's current location on the page.

- **Ease of Use:** The project is easy to set up and use, making it a great starting point for creating similar landing pages or interactive websites.
